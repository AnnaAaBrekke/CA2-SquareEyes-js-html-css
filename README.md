# "Square Eyes" Online Movie Store Project

## Overview
This project involves creating an interactive online movie store where users can watch high-quality movies directly from the creators without a subscription. The goal is to use JavaScript to dynamically display movies, manage a cart, and handle user interactions such as filtering movies by genre, adding to the cart, and checking out.
